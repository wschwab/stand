This frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is the frontend for the project. It follows a standard React structure.

Inside `src` the components are further subdivided into `pages` for basic pages,
and `actions` for actions taken on those pages. Logging in and creatin a new
account are considered pages, not actions.
